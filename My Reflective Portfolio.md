# Week 2 

```flow
Introduction to Many Model Thinking'(Part 1) - The Science of Many Models (Part 2) 
```


### What have I learnt this week?

In reflecting upon the tutorial activities and content in this week I have gained clearer understanding of what a model is in its basic meaning and applying it to real daily life, how models makes our life easier and how models contribute toward the simplification of achieving any complex organisational or personal decisions and goals.

I also acknowledge that this week helped me to understand using and creating models in daily life decisions will help: 


Topics | Key Learnings
------------ | -------------
Models | Data Organiser - Use of Models - Finding simplicity in complexity
Types of Models | 3 Techniques: Embodiment, anology, alternative reality approach
Using Models|7 Types: Reason, Explain, Design, Communicate, Act, Predict,Explore
The Wisdom Hierarchy | putting ‘Many Models’ into one use concept and how it is used to simplify human centred complex systems
Understanding data structures| Design, strategise and design 

 
 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Upon reflection, I thought I understood what what a model is and the use of in the business world, but I was not totally right, there was a lot of important basic information about that I never covered before 
I know now how to think models in each event/incident in life applying it to decisions and goals achievements

### What insights have I gained?

I gained new insights in experimenting life after learning about the main reasons behind the ‘Use of Models’ that are:



- Reason 
- Explain
- Design 
- Communicate
- Act
- Predict 
- Explore

These key learning points has been applied in my life since day one after this week (week 2 learning content) where I started resining about several exisiting practices on personal and on organisational levels, in why do people and groups have took this practice and act to make important decisions and improve the cycle of life


I have discovered a new way in how to ‘Think Outside The Box’ and use modelling concept just to identify and observe how people and organisations are using models for example in my meditation, a simple existing idea came up on my mind on how models that are used in ‘weather explanation/visualisation’ can be used to predict the weather.





### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My current *strengths* that I have observed after this week’s learnings include, is that I had very little basic knowledge of how complex systems and how they adapt and this was only from week 1 content, as I had no knowledge about how systems and models work and consist of until I went through the theories in week’s 2 module.


I acknowledge that my *weaknesses* were that before learning about this week’s content I had no idea what ‘models' are, and how decisions are made easier when applying this concept and it’s just not only simply learning a theory (i.e the many models thinking in the ‘wisdom of crowd theory’) and writing it down in an assignment or presenting it, but to go beyond that and practice it in real life where it applies. 


### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One of the challenges I have encountered was understanding why many is good, and how crowd accuracy works and calculating it, in specific the equation of the ‘diversity prediction theorem’  but after the lecture was finished I had to go over the whole module slides and going through slides from week 1 to understand some basics and along with some external sources and illustration videos from the web I was able eventually to understand the ‘Why’ of the theory


### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

It was observed that going straight to the lecture without previous preparation does not work for me as I have encountered some difficulties understanding some topics from the start, with this outcome and for the future I would prefer to prepare for the slides before the lecture slides and have a at least a basic understanding on the topic provided for the week by going through not only slides but also some external materials provoided in the subject like (The model thinker: What you need to know to make data work for you) book and other books too provided on Canvas.



### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

A good theory I have learned and found useful was the crowd wisdom theory.

I started  applying the crowd wisdom in my decision as I have started to realise that using the suggestion of different people helps me to choose a wise decision/ prediction instead of depending on my own personal thoughts which are not as accurate as the opinion/choice of many; 
 
Where I learnt that :

- **’Crowd accuracy = individual accuracy + diversity’** 

where the crowd’s wisdom comes from smart people who got similar thinking with loads of diversity and how to combining the three models of individual people’s predictions (categorical, linear, Markov, Lyapunov) can lead to more accurate predictions.

For example after learning this week’s content I had a new point of view of many events that happens daily and realised I have to apply this theory only after I understood this week’s content, i.e when I was predicting my weight in the gym, (even though the balance was there) but I done it for the experiment, I have predicted myself to be ’78.00 kg’, and then I asked every one of my group members at the gym separately (3 people) 




*Predictions were as following from Mike, Alan, Adam (pseudo-names) who are from different work background but like-minded group:

- Mike: 79.00 KG
- Alan: 81.00 KG
- Adam: 82.00 KG

Creating an average prediction of 80.67 KG

The first actual predicted value was 78.00 KG, so: 

- Mike: (79 − 78)2 = 1
- Alan: (81 − 78)2 = 9
- Adam: (82 − 78)2 = 16

Here the variation average will be 8.67 —> (80.67 − 78)2 = 7.1 (crowd’s error)

Noted that previous average prediction was 80.67 KG

 
Then, I calculated ‘diversity’ based on comparison of everyone’s prediction: 

- Mike: (79 − 80.67)2 = 2.8
- Alan: (81 − 80.67)2 = 0.1
- Adam: (82 − 80.67)2 = 1.8


Diversity (Average Variation) will be 1.6 with a crowd error of 7.1 giving an average error of: 8.7




# Week 3  

```flow
 A Supermarket of Models - People
```


### What have I learnt this week?

For me this week was very useful and significant as I developed new learnings about the core ideas and dilemmas that we face daily as humans, especially for my case at my work as I go through many business processes  and how we could do it if we apply modelling, talking here about ‘Modelling people’ and how to apply it through using the following models: 


**Rational**: How people use the ‘Optimise to Maximise’ concept in order to optimise for their goals
**Behavioural**: this model uses observations of human behaviours, modelling them as close as possible in order to predict
**Rule-Based**: learnt interesting content about rule based in how psychology is used to understand some rules that people seems to be using predicting how they will (i.e. The Schelling model)


**Signalling**: I learnt about its types (Continous & Discrete) but what more caught my attention is the ‘The girl in the foyer’ story that was one of the best stories that I read in long time, maybe because it relates to us as student going through our internships and looking for our experience in the near future, but what a great example to show the idea behind signalling, throwing herself  into the lion’s den to achieve her goal, which formed the ‘Costly Signalling Theory’
**Value and Power**: I learnt in this concept how that the collective output cannot be separated into individual components, how do we divide values and how it contributes toward the whole game value.







### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Having learned and read about the module’s (3) content, I have gained some key learning points outlined below 

KEY LEARNINGS & EXAMPLES of MODELS: 

Rational Actor Model: The person 1 & 2 was a good example about rational behaviour where one of them enjoys Friday nights out and the other who enjoys staying home and how 2 then depends on 1 and assume rationality and then meeting each other at the first persons preferred place  ) this helps to understand ‘rationality model’ and how it all depends on the individuals ‘Utility function’ not their selfishness.

Insert Flow here —> resulting that we can only see relational behaviour when there are : high stakes - repeated decisions - decisions from group thinking- easy choices to make 

Behavioural Models: the guessing example was a great way in me understanding the ‘Anchoring Bias’ concept in how looking on first guess can affect the next guess. 
Rule-based Models: **Fixed** and **Adaptive** rules is what I learnt new in this week where in fixed rules common sense applies, while in adaptive that divides into (Gradient-based method) & (Evolutionary Strategy).








### What insights have I gained?

New understandings and knowledge I have obtained after learning about this week’s topic and after my participation in the’Models Rankings’ vote and opinion slide, choosing models like :  

Modelling People
Decision Making
Signalling 
Value & Power


I Discovered : 
The three types of people modelling (Rational - Behavioural - Rule-based)
Taking into consideration the what I learnt about ‘Decision Making’ I have practiced yesterday a new technique based on module’s 3 content, is when I wanted to decide which subject to study that day, and after applying *Quantitative Decision* concept 
That signalling was practiced every day in my life without me noticing and after noticing now I can relate to this week’s content about signalling (i.e today I noticed good example of signalling that how one muscular guy at the gym was trying to show off his muscles in front of some girl In front of him and she was signalling back to him that she likes/interested by showing him the she is looking at him)
Value & Power: gained important knowledge on the *coalition* of players in the *Cooperative Games* example in how to assign values to participants that participate in that game by capturing collective work and joint projects and as this (cooperative game) focuses on competitions between groups, I have experienced some situation at my work where the main company that we are sub-contracting for had released their tender and another sub-contract company now is competing against us to get the contract  , this an example of how the two companies using their own marketing and competing strategies and *bargaining power* to put their hands on that contract and finally when our company has partnered with another famous tech company that helps in data entry and records, and here the *Shapley Value* player was added (external tech company) to achieve that goal and get the contract.



### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

* Weakness 
- I was not yet certain about some of the topics about shapely value until I read the related content on the book provided on UTS Canvas, as this concept was a bit hard to understand even from it’s tile (Shapely Value) and I understood and gained that knowledge after the experience I had at work that I mentioned above


* Strength:
- I now feel more confident about modelling people and the other given models what they mean and how they apply in our daily work and personal life, and my strength now and which I always wanted to learn was in decision trees and how it makes it easy to collect data and make decisions based on it’s data processing technique.




### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Some peaks I have experienced and some humps has stopped me during going through this week’s content, one of the challenges I have observed was in the ‘Value and power’ concept where after reading the examples provided there, especially the LOTB story/example if found out that I can’t fully relate to the idea unless I have a basic understanding on it to read about it before.

So, I had to go back to the first slide and find out if we have any recommended readings from books provided such as ‘The model thinker: What you need to know to make data work for you. Hachette UK, 2018’ For Page & Scott E, where this has gave more insight about what the concept means and how the author represent some models that quantifies the (value & power) of individual actors.



### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Because I was not confident about some topics represented in this module such as (power & value) I will need next time to read the *recommended readings* as well as *ASK*, ask the tutor before the tutorial/lecture ends to give more *Example* on the suspicious topic, as I find myself understanding any content by looking at real life examples no matter what background it is. 



### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

I have learned about the Rule-based model, the Schelling model for example, this is very essential knowledge for me, I found it useful and effective; where the rules that are set in our life as humans sometimes are simplifying the complexity in the ‘model’ itself through fixed and adaptive types in either Gradient-based method or the Evolutionary strategy. 

Personal Experience: And a situation that happened with me experiencing the (Fixed Rule) was how I had to take the same route driving to work from points (A) —> (B) through normal route that takes 40 minutes and then *Adaptive Rule* applied here, when I was taking with me in the car my colleague who is my neighbour as well due to an issue in his car where he suggests with reasons why I should take the M5 motorway to get to work where it takes us 28 minutes and we had to take it and here I had to adapt to this rule/decision and it was actually better idea, that was a great experience for me to practice this concept in real life !
