# Week 2 

```flow
Introduction to Many Model Thinking'(Part 1) - The Science of Many Models (Part 2) 
```


### What have I learnt this week?

In reflecting upon the tutorial activities and content in this week I have gained clearer understanding of what a model is in its basic meaning and applying it to real daily life, how models makes our life easier and how models contribute toward the simplification of achieving any complex organisational or personal decisions and goals.

I also acknowledge that this week helped me to understand using and creating models in daily life decisions will help: 


Topics | Key Learnings
------------ | -------------
Models | Data Organiser - Use of Models - Finding simplicity in complexity
Types of Models | 3 Techniques: Embodiment, anology, alternative reality approach
Using Models|7 Types: Reason, Explain, Design, Communicate, Act, Predict,Explore
The Wisdom Hierarchy | putting ‘Many Models’ into one use concept and how it is used to simplify human centred complex systems
Understanding data structures| Design, strategise and design 

 
 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Upon reflection, I thought I understood what what a model is and the use of in the business world, but I was not totally right, there was a lot of important basic information about that I never covered before 
I know now how to think models in each event/incident in life applying it to decisions and goals achievements

### What insights have I gained?

I gained new insights in experimenting life after learning about the main reasons behind the ‘Use of Models’ that are:


```flow
- Reason 
- Explain
- Design 
- Communicate
- Act
- Predict 
- Explore
```
These key learning points has been applied in my life since day one after this week (week 2 learning content) where I started resining about several exisiting practices on personal and on organisational levels, in why do people and groups have took this practice and act to make important decisions and improve the cycle of life


I have discovered a new way in how to ‘Think Outside The Box’ and use modelling concept just to identify and observe how people and organisations are using models for example in my meditation, a simple existing idea came up on my mind on how models that are used in ‘weather explanation/visualisation’ can be used to predict the weather.





### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My current **strengths** that I have observed after this week’s learnings include, is that I had very little basic knowledge of how complex systems and how they adapt and this was only from week 1 content, as I had no knowledge about how systems and models work and consist of until I went through the theories in week’s 2 module.


I acknowledge that my **weaknesses** were that before learning about this week’s content I had no idea what ‘models' are, and how decisions are made easier when applying this concept and it’s just not only simply learning a theory. 
(i.e the many models thinking in the ‘wisdom of crowd theory’) and writing it down in an assignment or presenting it, but to go beyond that and practice it in real life where it applies. 


### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One of the **challenges** I have encountered was understanding why many is good, and how crowd accuracy works and calculating it, in specific the equation of the ‘diversity prediction theorem’  but after the lecture was finished I had to go over the whole module slides and going through slides from week 1 to understand some basics and along with some external sources and illustration videos from the web I was able eventually to understand the ‘Why’ of the theory


### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

It was observed that going straight to the lecture without previous preparation does not work for me as I have encountered some difficulties understanding some topics from the start, with this outcome and for the future I would prefer to prepare for the slides before the lecture starts and have a at least a basic understanding on the topic provided for the week by going through not only slides but also some external materials provoided in the subject like **(The model thinker: What you need to know to make data work for you)** book and other books too posted on Canvas.



### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

A good theory I have learned and found useful was the crowd wisdom theory.

I started  applying the crowd wisdom in my decision as I have started to realise that using the suggestion of different people helps me to choose a wise decision/ prediction instead of depending on my own personal thoughts which are not as accurate as the opinion/choice of many; 
 
Where I learnt that :

- **’Crowd accuracy = individual accuracy + diversity’** 

where the crowd’s wisdom comes from smart people who got similar thinking with loads of diversity and how to combining the three models of individual people’s predictions (categorical, linear, Markov, Lyapunov) can lead to more accurate predictions.

For example after learning this week’s content I had a new point of view of many events that happens daily and realised I have to apply this theory only after I understood this week’s content, i.e when I was predicting my weight in the gym, (even though the balance was there) but I done it for the experiment, I have predicted myself to be ’78.00 kg’, and then I asked every one of my group members at the gym separately (3 people) 



```flow
*Predictions were as following from Mike, Alan, Adam (pseudo-names) who are from different work background but like-minded group:

- Mike: 79.00 KG
- Alan: 81.00 KG
- Adam: 82.00 KG

Creating an average prediction of 80.67 KG

The first actual predicted value was 78.00 KG, so: 

- Mike: (79 − 78)2 = 1
- Alan: (81 − 78)2 = 9
- Adam: (82 − 78)2 = 16

Here the variation average will be 8.67 —> (80.67 − 78)2 = 7.1 (crowd’s error)

Noted that previous average prediction was 80.67 KG

 
Then, I calculated ‘diversity’ based on comparison of everyone’s prediction: 

- Mike: (79 − 80.67)2 = 2.8
- Alan: (81 − 80.67)2 = 0.1
- Adam: (82 − 80.67)2 = 1.8


Diversity (Average Variation) will be 1.6 with a crowd error of 7.1 giving an average error of: 8.7
```




# Week 3  

```flow
 A Supermarket of Models - People
```


### What have I learnt this week?

For me this week was very useful and significant as I developed new learnings about the core ideas and dilemmas that we face daily as humans, especially for my case at my work as I go through many business processes  and how we could do it if we apply modelling, talking here about ‘Modelling people’ and how to apply it through using the following models: 


**Rational**: 
```flow
How people use the ‘Optimise to Maximise’ concept in order to optimise for their goal.
```

**Behavioural**: 
```flow
this model uses observations of human behaviours, modelling them as close as possible in order to predict.
```

**Rule-Based**: 
```flow
learnt interesting content about rule based in how psychology is used to understand some rules that people seems to be using predicting how they will (i.e. The Schelling model)
```

**Signalling**: 

```flow
I learnt about its types (Continous & Discrete) but what more caught my attention is the ‘The girl in the foyer’ story that was one of the best stories that I read in long time, maybe because it relates to us as student going through our internships and looking for our experience in the near future, but what a great example to show the idea behind signalling, throwing herself  into the lion’s den to achieve her goal, which formed the ‘Costly Signalling Theory’.
```

**Value and Power**: 
```flow
I learnt in this concept how that the collective output cannot be separated into individual components, how do we divide values and how it contributes toward the whole game value.
```


### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Having learned and read about the module’s (3) content, I have gained some key learning points outlined below 
```flow
KEY LEARNINGS & EXAMPLES of MODELS: 
```
Rational Actor Model: The person 1 & 2 was a good example about rational behaviour where one of them enjoys Friday nights out and the other who enjoys staying home and how 2 then depends on 1 and assume rationality and then meeting each other at the first persons preferred place  ) this helps to understand ‘rationality model’ and how it all depends on the individuals ‘Utility function’ not their selfishness.



- Resulting: that we can only see relational behaviour when : high stakes - repeated decisions - decisions from group thinking- easy choices to make

Relational Model | observation
------------| -------------
     A ------->    High Stakes
     B ------->    Repeated Decisions
     C ------->    Eeasy Choice Making

Behavioural Models: the guessing example was a great way in me understanding the ‘Anchoring Bias’ concept in how looking on first guess can affect the next guess. 
Rule-based Models: **Fixed** and **Adaptive** rules is what I learnt new in this week where in fixed rules common sense applies, while in adaptive that divides into (Gradient-based method) & (Evolutionary Strategy).



### What insights have I gained?

New understandings and knowledge I have obtained after learning about this week’s topic and after my participation in the’Models Rankings’ vote and opinion slide, choosing models like :  

```flow
Modelling People
Decision Making
Signalling 
Value & Power
```
```flow
I Discovered : 
```

- The three types of people modelling **(Rational - Behavioural - Rule-based)**

Taking into consideration the what I learnt about ‘Decision Making’ I have practiced yesterday a new technique based on module’s 3 content, is when I wanted to decide which subject to study that day, and after applying **Quantitative Decision** concept 
That signalling was practiced every day in my life without me noticing and after noticing now I can relate to this week’s content about signalling ---> (i.e today I noticed good example of signalling that how one muscular guy at the gym was trying to show off his muscles in front of some girl In front of him and she was signalling back to him that she likes/interested by showing him the she is looking at him)


**Value & Power**: gained important knowledge on the *coalition* of players in the **Cooperative Games** example in how to assign values to participants that participate in that game by capturing collective work and joint projects and as this (cooperative game) focuses on competitions between groups, I have experienced some situation at my work where the main company that we are sub-contracting for had released their tender and another sub-contract company now is competing against us to get the contract  , this an example of how the two companies using their own marketing and competing strategies and **bargaining power** to put their hands on that contract and finally when our company has partnered with another famous tech company that helps in data entry and records, and here the **shapley Value** player was added (external tech company) to achieve that goal and get the contract.



### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

```flow

* Weaknesses 

```
- I was not yet certain about some of the topics about shapely value until I read the related content on the book provided on UTS Canvas, as this concept was a bit hard to understand even from it’s tile (Shapely Value) and I understood and gained that knowledge after the experience I had at work that I mentioned above

```flow

* Strength:

```
- I now feel more confident about modelling people and the other given models what they mean and how they apply in our daily work and personal life, and my strength now and which I always wanted to learn was in decision trees and how it makes it easy to collect data and make decisions based on it’s data processing technique.




### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Some peaks I have experienced and some humps has stopped me during going through this week’s content, one of the challenges I have observed was in the ‘Value and power’ concept where after reading the examples provided there, especially the **LOTB** story/example if found out that I can’t fully relate to the idea unless I have a basic understanding on it to read about it before.

So, I had to go back to the first slide and find out if we have any recommended readings from books provided such as ‘The model thinker: What you need to know to make data work for you. **Hachette UK, 2018’ For Page & Scott E**, where this has gave more insight about what the concept means and how the author represent some models that quantifies the (value & power) of individual actors.



### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Because I was not confident about some topics represented in this module such as (power & value) I will need next time to read the *recommended readings* as well as **ASK**, ask the tutor before the tutorial/lecture ends to give more *Example* on the suspicious topic, as I find myself understanding any content by looking at real life examples no matter what background it is. 



### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

I have learned about the Rule-based model, the Schelling model for example, this is very essential knowledge for me, I found it useful and effective; where the rules that are set in our life as humans sometimes are simplifying the complexity in the ‘model’ itself through fixed and adaptive types in either Gradient-based method or the Evolutionary strategy. 

Theory  | Topic
------------ | -------------
Rule Based Model  | Schelling Moel


**Personal Experience:** And a situation that happened with me experiencing the (Fixed Rule) was how I had to take the same route driving to work from points (A) —> (B) through normal route that takes 40 minutes and then **Adaptive Rule** applied here, when I was taking with me in the car my colleague who is my neighbour as well due to an issue in his car where he suggests with reasons why I should take the M5 motorway to get to work where it takes us 28 minutes and we had to take it and here I had to adapt to this rule/decision and it was actually better idea, that was a great experience for me to practice this concept in real life !

Model | Topic
------------ | -------------
Fixed  | Gradient-based method
Adaptive | Evolutionary strategy

 



# Week 4   


```flow
Representing human-centred complex systems
```


### What have I learnt this week?

Based on this week’s learning outcome, I can say I have significantly improved my knowledge on the basic definition of a system and **system thinking** to **System Dynamics** models, learned more about their goal which is going 'feedbacks' (positive & negative) and 'interdependencies' to analyse a certain system, as well as identifying the system’s boundaries such as 

swimming  pool   the ocean analogy
---------------| -----------------


As well as how edges are clearly defined in the pool and stepping to the ocean (complex/larger system) after knowing how to think in systems in small system first with clear boundaries, illustrated by diagrams such as:

Casual Loop Diagrams   
--------------------|


to the fundamental modes of interaction: 

- Exponential growth 
- Goal-seeking, and oscillation

into **Networks** theory, its: 
- Degree
_ Path length
- Connectedness
- Clustering coefficien              Random             Random             Lattice
- Logic + ways a network can form: ----------------|---------------|----------------|

and its functionality (from **6 Degree of Separation form** to **Random Clique Network**








### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I always thought I know what system thinking is based on ‘intuition’ but after going through this content for week 4, I realised I had a very little basic knowledge about how to think in terms of systems, and this is due to my limited knowledge in basic topic (definition of a system), and after I knew how to define a system through examples given in the lecture, I was able to define my point of view on how to think in systems taking into consideration the definition of System dynamics model and it’s parts which I was introduced to in this interesting lecture 




### What insights have I gained?

New insights I have gained and some key learning points are in:


* System Dynamics: this concept introduced me to system-dynamics models that uses interdependencies and feedback to analyse the ‘system’ // NSERT CAHRT HERE that consists (sources, sinks, stocks, flows, rates, and constants) as well as I understood in depth and by examples what a system is and what does it consist of, to thinking in terms of systems how to acknowledge the fact that everything around us is *interconnected* and how all these small seperate parts connect together forming the system, and taking into consideration the *System Boundary* 





### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?


I have noticed throughout this week from my strengths that I feel confident 
And my noticed weakness were th

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One of the challenges is that I felt overwhelmed with the amount of new information at once
the reason is that my problem relies in me as  take longer than can average person to understand a topic as I would like to cover all of the topic’s corners and subheading and how it works through several examples, for example when trying to understand ‘Thinking in systems’ concept, while the class have jumped to system dynamics I found it a bit hard to understand all the points of system dynamics while the lecture was going on, so I had to review it after the lecture with examples from the web.


### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Based on the challenges and weaknesses noticed this week, and taking the advantage from this reflective entry to understand myself in depth through experiences I had this week specifically, I can say that big improvement has happened in my way of thinking, for next time I would think differently for example in the case of covering topics during live lecture, I would focus more on examples of each topic more than its formal definition and listen carefully to questions asked from colleagues which I found out it helps in understanding what my concern is even though their question wasn’t related directly to my topic.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

It is always a good idea in any..or when..  to take the context of a current situate or current traditions, and nowadays as we more and more reliable on the internet day after day and this is due to its strong, solid, and smart infrastructure, this infrastructure uses ‘Networks’ as a core to connect devices and people that keeps the whole world running. ‘Network Theory’ has proven its importance and usefulness, and the reason is those graph theories used, and the *Networks Structures* that forms a network playing a vital role in making network theory useful and solving its problems; to the *Logic of Network Formation* and how agents (nodes) make their decisions in connecting to other agents forming i.e. random, small-world, and lattice networks, and how when these nodes interact forming a *Network Function*, and this is very useful in the case of our current pandemic in fighting the virus and in a try to contain it faster and wiser as the example given on ‘Vaccination’ of the highly connected people in the society, like bus drivers, and teachers.









# Week 5


```flow
Aggregating Decision and Behaviour
```


### What have I learnt this week?

My learnings this week was … which included some very useful points that I always wanted to go through: 

1. *’Probability Distributions’*, for me understanding probability distributions was based on understanding: 

Aggregation
Why probability and (why-where-when) do we use it 
How distributions is applied illustrated by real life examples (i.e blood type example)
Random variables and its types (Discrete & Continuous)
Usefulness of probability distributions in predictions and its proved statistics.


1.1 Normal Distributions: 
The bell curve (Mean = Mode = Median)
Normal distributions variables (9 useful examples on close variables)
The logic behind the equal distributions of variables through three types of distributions used : Normal, Bell Curve or Gaussian distributions in an order of (Low IQ < Average IQ > High IQ)

1.2 Central limit Theorem: 
1.3 Applying distribution knowledge to socio-technical systems
1.4 Testing significance of mean values by using the regularity of the ‘normal distribution’
1.5 Six Segma quality control and how it applies in normal distributions

2. *Power Law Distributions * which described by *Long/Heavy-tailed-Distributions 
* 2.1 Power laws (y = Cx^-a)
2.2 Power laws Parameters (a) which is the slope of the distributions
2.3 Zipf’s laws
2.4. Power Laws Models
2.5. Significance of Long Tail Distributions and how its described for beginners (Equity, Catastrophes) 

3. *Linear Variables*
3.1. Linear Regression
3.2 Sign, Significance, and Magnitude.
3.3 Multiple Variables
3.4 examples on the ‘Big Coefficient vs New Reality Thinking’



### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I learnt about different types of distributions where I knew about the normal distribution in its basic definitions and rules, but I was newly introduced to other types of distributions, and most important ho to apply such distributions in several systems (i.e. Socio-technical Systems), I was introduced to the power laws (its parameters and models) as well  as I linear variables where the new part for me to learn in the this section was the (Multiple variables) concept in the ‘Linear Models’ using linear modelling techniques in a non-linear world that we live in; (fitting these techniques into non-linear functions).



### What insights have I gained?

In this week I have gained new insights on how to use the ‘Implications of long tails’ to get a more accurate prediction of the sizes of a particular event, for example on earthquake where we know what to expect in case of this earthquake happens and to avoid the bad effects resulting from this earthquake at least.






### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My weaknesses relied in understating the normal distribution concept, even though it seems straight forward where I had to give myself examples from several real world problems and real world events to understand it mechanism. 
This resulted in me gaining new strengths on how to apply this knowledge of distributions to socio-technical systems, 



### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Understating the CLT (central limit theorem) was a bit challenging for me at the beginning and this due to missing knowledge on how ‘Normal Distribution’ works and where it applies
By watching the video posted in the lecture slides especially the video (The central limit theorem - Clearly explained) and especially going back to understanding the concept of ‘Normal Distribution’ and the logic behind it and knowing how to take ‘samples’, plot the related ‘distributions’ and calculate the ‘sample mean’ I was able then to form a solid understanding on where CLT applies and how to use it.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

For my future lessons or even in my career, if the context of explaining a new concept related to normal distribution, then I would convince myself to take a pre-requisite understanding on what it means and then jump to it’s techniques (gathering samples - calculating mean and SD - and defining its category based on results)


### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?


After learning this week’s concepts about linear & non-linear functions and how powerful and useful *Linear Regression* might be applying it to real world issue like our current pandemic COVID-19, that I thought about right after the lecture finished; which has proven its  

For example in *multiple linear regression model* in: 

 *Predicting the impact of COVID-19 on AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIES: (calculating data by Australian Department of Education) —> 

*predicting its impacts on:* 
Revenue (decreased) - Dependent Variable
Number of international students enrolments (decrease) - Independent Variable
Number of Full time positions at the universities (negatively affected) - Independent Variable








# Week 6



```flow
How Complex Systems Evolve in Time
```


### What have I learnt this week?

*My learnings for this week is outlying in the key points below: 

*Path Dependence*: how the probability of the outcome depend upon the sequence of past outcomes
Path dependent outcomes
Path dependent equilibrium


*Urn Models* :
Bernoulli
Polya Process 
Balancing

*Random Walks*
Finite memory random walks 
Math  behind random walks concept

*Concavity and Convexity in (Growth)*
Four Models of Economic growth: 
Exponential growth 
Economic growth (using a primitive economy growth model)
Solow’s growth model
Extensions (continuity of growth)

*Effects of Broadcast, Diffusion, Contagion on spreading information/diseases, etc.*

*Markov Process*
* *Equlibrium: how Lyapunov functions map models outcomes*


### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

This week I learned about new model *Broadcasting* and how media can be a vital player in affecting society and wining against the enemy for example thinking about our current pandemic ‘COVID-19’ we can see the source (i.e government) how they can manage media (media like television, radio, or the internet-Social media and the web) to play a positive role spreading information about self-protection procedures (wearing face masks - Hygiene - Social Distancing) to contain the virus and in return protecting the society, even though this lived everyday and viewed by us on social media almost daily, but the actual model (broadcasting) was a new learning point for me



### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I observed that I had some weaknesses during learning .. summarised in understanding how SIR model works where I haven’t had previous knowledge on how the model works, this has lead me to go over the materials again for this week and researching media and web for examples; and now I can relate to an example in using the SIR model (susceptible, infected, recovered individuals & groups ) helping contain the spread of COVID-19 using 
where they look good in containing the virus spread where this has add to my strengths column.





### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Challenges faced in this week was represented by understanding the broadcast model use.
Where I had to get help from YouTube videos and shot courses overviews on what is the model in its basic definition, when to use the model and  how to use the formula as it is important form me as we were as a group have decided to use this model in the next week’s assignment, and from this I learned applying the following formula  adding this key learnings to my strength this week: 

* I(t+1) = I(t) + (P(broad) . S(t));  where: 
p (broad): broadcast probability.
I (t): number of ‘informed’ people at a given time
S(t): number of ‘susceptible’ people at a given time

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
For next time I would review the lecture topic ahead, before the lecture starts doing my pre-work as in the researching, so I have a knowledge of what  is going on and this is what I’m going to do next lecture starting from this weekend before my second class which is next week.



### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

One good theory found useful for me in this week’s learning was the Granovetter Threshold theory in the Granovetter’s Riot Model,  where threshold models were used to model groups behaviours resulting in social influence, and this was clearly illustrated in the interesting example of the two cities (Town A & B) and how a bunch of ‘low threshold people’  (Town A) influence individuals to join the ‘store break in’ starting a riot, and then the higher threshold people in Town B how the guy holding the 1 threshold breaks into the store triggering people to call the cops, and creating no riots in that scenario.




# Week 7

```flow
Complexity and Emergent Behaviour (Part 1)
```



### What have I learnt this week?

I learnt from this week’s topic () Complexity and Emergent Behaviour a bunch of concepts and .. summarised in: 

**Segregation & Peer Effects:**
Schelling’s Segregation Mode
Measuring Segregation
 Granovetter's Model
 Standing Ovation Model
 And how to explore segregation in Netlogo


**Coordination & Culture:**
Introduction to culture and how it affects our behaviour according to Tyler, Boaz, & Trilling.
Pure coordination model
Emergence of culture
Coordination and Consistency

**Social Learning: Replicator Dynamics:**
 Replicator Equation:
 - Fisher's Theorem




### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

What I knew this week that I didn’t know before is the Replicator equation under the topic of Replicator dynamics that divides into three different disciplines:

- Psychology in order to model learning
- Economics that works on modelling population on people’s learn ing
- Ecology that models evolution


### What insights have I gained?

Upon going through this week’s lecture I have obtained new insights  about ‘Characterising Culture’ its survival , self-expression, traditional, and secular rational values and how to compare them graphically using geographical points showing people from different cultural backgrounds



### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

Before my learnings in this week, and due to the promise I told myself to prepare on every week before the lecture starts I had to prepare as a pre-work on this week’s topic **‘Culture & Coordination’** but still my weakness showed up like on how ‘pure coordination model works’ which I then understood through the examples given in the lecture slides which were very interesting and easy to understand (Ketchup Question - Electric Plug -Driving on the Left and right).


### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

Some topics were challenging for me to understand was the replicator equation, where I had to decompose it and substitute in numbers from real scenario related to social learning in order to understand it.


### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I see improvement needs to be done for the next time is to focus efforts on understating the concept basics first before going to the statistics of it, by other words to understand what each topic is talking about , how it applies on our context and then understand the **WHY** why an equation/model is needed in this model and then if this path is applied, I will guarantee understanding how related mathematical/statistical formulas work and why we should use it(importance of using it).



### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

I learnt about Fisher Theorem in which was one of the theories I found interesting and super useful when it comes to 'Replicator Dynamics’. Which is the first and one of the most important game dynamic studied in connection with the evolutionary game theory 

 

 

# Week 8



```flow
Representing human-centred complex systems
```


### What have I learnt this week?

```flow
Important elements were presented in this week’s module, where the main content was about the second part of ‘Complexity and emergent behaviour’ topic delivering three learning outcomes: 


**i.** I learnt a strategy called (The Colonel Blotto Game) a very interesting game, which is a zero-sum game which players are meant to distribute limited given resources over different resources. 

**ii.**  My second learning outcome was about cooperation illustrated through an interesting dilemma (Prisoner’s Dilemma), which is the most known game in ‘Game Theory’  where the game consists of two players who have the choice either to cooperate or they defect, which in case of cooperation both players get 4 as a payoff or 2 as a defect in the case of no cooperation, and if one of them defected, then the individual that chose to defect will get a 6 as a payoff.


**iii.** Ending with the third learning outcome a self study activity which was a ‘collective action problems’ talking about the real world problems and how they apply in contribution and how an individual makes choices to contribute using mathematical/statistical equations to prove that, comparing s the individual’s payoff, in case of cooperation and not cooperation using the formula:  P= xi + ∑Xj

```





### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

All of the three main topic I had no previous knowledge about, even though they might be practiced daily in front us through media platforms or even in our local daily interactions and we are not aware of it


Colonel Blotto Game : I had no idea what this game is used for and how it works, but now after playing it against my colleagues in class and taking my time of thinking of a solution, I can say I had to use some skills and the concept was settled in my mind due to this experience
Prisoner’s Dilemma: I have The idea of …but without me noticing nut I leant about it this week especially from the examples shown in it’s slide, and specifically (Trump vs Clinton) example.
Collective Actions Problems (Cooperation): where I learnt about how to apply the equation ```flow P= xi + ∑Xj ``` that I didn’t know it exists and thinking that was cost cooperation and non-cooperation is estimated.









### What insights have I gained?

Talking about the Colonel Blotto Game I can say that form this concept I learned how to increase my chances of wining in any type of battle field applying it to real life problems



### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My weakness were represented in understanding how the Colonel Blotto Game works and what is meant to win the game (increasing chances of wining), where I had to do a lot of researches along with what I learnt in this module, and this added it to my strength especially when playing the game Dr. Juan gave us, making us think in getting a solution that has the greatest value after entering the castles, this was a very useful strategy to understand the concept 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One of the main challenges I have encountered was installing Jupyter lab in order to push the report in the group assignment to the Github profile of our group leader “James Turong” a day before the assignment was due
where I tried a lot installing several versions of extension of GIT but with no good result, and eventually I had to ask Dr. Juan for help where in a private zoom session he guided me how to do it and installed the software and extensions for me and I was ready to submit and found out that my problem was using an old version of ANACONDA installed on my machine 3 years ago.


### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Based on the challenges I had in this module and the perceived strengths and weaknesses I would prepare earlier for next time and communicate with other groups on how they setup their accounts (Jupyter and GIT extensions) at least a week before the due date of the assignment, and this just avoiding the unexpected situations that might lead in late assignment submission.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?


A good theory I learned in this module and was proved useful was the Colonel Blotto Game theory as it is a well studied theory and my choice was due to the proven facts and results shown, and from what I learnt and from the main reason is because when we vary the two parameters of the game by changing the number of the battlefields or giving one of the players more resources than the other player we can get an insight of the likely to win players.
