### MY 41189 REFLECTIVE PORTFOLIO below contains my thoughts about the subject ‘Introduction to Human Centred Complex System (41189), brainstorming ideas and new content that are represented in this interesting subject,  reflecting on what have I learnt from it on weekly basis; including insights I have gained form my point of view, observations, what was my weaknesses and how they became strengths after learning, how can I improve based on these learning outcomes.






# Week 2 



### What have I learnt this week?

In reflecting upon the tutorial activities and content in this week I have gained clearer understanding of what a model is in its basic meaning and applying it to real daily life, how models makes our life easier and how models contribute toward the simplification of achieving any complex organisational or personal decisions and goals.

I also acknowledge that this week has taught me that using and creating models in daily life decisions will help: 

Being an intelligent citizen of the world and improve business intelligence
Think clearer
Understand how to read data structures and how they are formed
Design, strategise and design 

Other key learnings include:

Finding simplicity in complexity
The science behind the ‘Many Models’ concept and how it is used to simplify human centred complex systems 
The Wisdom Hierarchy




### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Upon reflection, I thought I understood what what a model is and the use of in the business world, but I was not totally right, there was a lot of important basic information about that I never covered before 
I know now how to think models in each event/incident in life applying it to decisions and goals achievements

### What insights have I gained?

I gained new insights in experimenting life after learning about the main reasons behind the ‘Use of Models’ that are:

- Reason 
- Explain
- Design 
- Communicate
- Act
- Predict 
- Explore

These key learning points has been applied in my life since day one after this week (week 2 learning content) where I started resining about several exisiting practices on personal and on organisational levels, in why do people and groups have took this practice and act to make important decisions and improve the cycle of life


I have discovered a new way in how to ‘Think Outside The Box’ and use modelling concept just to identify and observe how people and organisations are using models for example in my meditation, a simple existing idea came up on my mind on how models that are used in ‘weather explanation/visualisation’ can be used to predict the weather.





### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

My current *strengths* that I have observed after this week’s learnings include, is that I had very little basic knowledge of how complex systems and how they adapt and this was only from week 1 content, as I had no knowledge about how systems and models work and consist of until I went through the theories in week’s 2 module.


I acknowledge that my *weaknesses* were that before learning about this week’s content I had no idea what ‘models' are, and how decisions are made easier when applying this concept and it’s just not only simply learning a theory (i.e the many models thinking in the ‘wisdom of crowd theory’) and writing it down in an assignment or presenting it, but to go beyond that and practice it in real life where it applies. 


### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

One of the challenges I have encountered was understanding why many is good, and how crowd accuracy works and calculating it, in specific the equation of the ‘diversity prediction theorem’  but after the lecture was finished I had to go over the whole module slides and going through slides from week 1 to understand some basics and along with some external sources and illustration videos from the web I was able eventually to understand the ‘Why’ of the theory


### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

It was observed that going straight to the lecture without previous preparation does not work for me as I have encountered some difficulties understanding some topics from the start, with this outcome and for the future I would prefer to prepare for the slides before the lecture slides and have a at least a basic understanding on the topic provided for the week by going through not only slides but also some external materials provoided in the subject like (The model thinker: What you need to know to make data work for you) book and other books too provided on Canvas.



### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

A good theory I have learned and found useful was the crowd wisdom theory.

I started  applying the crowd wisdom in my decision as I have started to realise that using the suggestion of different people helps me to choose a wise decision/ prediction instead of depending on my own personal thoughts which are not as accurate as the opinion/choice of many; 

Where I learnt that :

- *’Crowd accuracy = individual accuracy + diversity’* 

where the crowd’s wisdom comes from smart people who got similar thinking with loads of diversity and how to combining the three models of individual people’s predictions (categorical, linear, Markov, Lyapunov) can lead to more accurate predictions.

For example after learning this week’s content I had a new point of view of many events that happens daily and realised I have to apply this theory only after I understood this week’s content, i.e when I was predicting my weight in the gym, (even though the balance was there) but I done it for the experiment, I have predicted myself to be ’78.00 kg’, and then I asked every one of my group members at the gym separately (3 people) 




*Predictions were as following from Mike, Alan, Adam (pseudo-names) who are from different work background but like-minded group:

- Mike: 79.00 KG
- Alan: 81.00 KG
- Adam: 82.00 KG

Creating an average prediction of 80.67 KG

The first actual predicted value was 78.00 KG, so: 

- Mike: (79 − 78)2 = 1
- Alan: (81 − 78)2 = 9
- Adam: (82 − 78)2 = 16

Here the variation average will be 8.67 —> (80.67 − 78)2 = 7.1 (crowd’s error)

Noted that previous average prediction was 80.67 KG

 
Then, I calculated ‘diversity’ based on comparison of everyone’s prediction: 

- Mike: (79 − 80.67)2 = 2.8
- Alan: (81 − 80.67)2 = 0.1
- Adam: (82 − 80.67)2 = 1.8


Diversity (Average Variation) will be 1.6 with a crowd error of 7.1 giving an average error of: 8.7
